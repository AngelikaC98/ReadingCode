// The variable greeting is declared using let, and the value "Hello, world!", which is a string, is assigned to it. 
//This code stores a greeting text in the variable, which can be used later in the program.
let greeting = "Hello, world!";

// Here on this example we can see functions which we will see on our html website. We put command about "greating", 
// but this mean we will se Hello world on our website, because we told about meaning of greating.

document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = greeting;

//from now on all the HTML files will look the same so there is no need to comment them
